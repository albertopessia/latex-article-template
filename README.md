# Basic LaTeX2e article template

This repository contains a standard template for an empty LaTeX article.
The purpose is to save a lot of time when starting a new manuscript.

The template comes with packages and macros that I often use when writing articles.
It also serves as a collection of useful packages (and LaTeX tricks) that I discovered during my career.
